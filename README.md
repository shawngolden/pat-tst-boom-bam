## Workflow to Make Changes
To make and commit changes, follow these steps.

1. Create a new branch when you start working on a new feature <code>(Plugins > Git > New branch)</code>
2. Work normally on your design
3. Save file
4. Commit the changes with a meaningful message describing them. The plugin will extract the artboards in your file in order to show the differences easily. <code>(Plugins > Git > Commit)</code>
5. Push your changes to the remote. <code>(Plugins > Git > Push)</code>
6. Create a pull request from your branch to the master branch.
7. Notify a reviewer (shawng@ or rcardneau@) to take a look at your changes.
8. If everything looks good, reviewer will merge your commit into the master file.
9. Delete the branch you initially created in step 1
